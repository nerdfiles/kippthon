# Kippthon

A Python Wrapper and CLI for Kippt. There's some Django stuff I want to do as well.
We're assuming $ alias kippt='[path]/main.py' for the moment. 

## Version

0.0.1

## @todo

1. Django stuff (Why is it here to begin with?)
2. Documentation
3. Settings and config
4. Prepare for distribution
